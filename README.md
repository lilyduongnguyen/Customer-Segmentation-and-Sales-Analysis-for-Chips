# Customer Segmentation and Sales Analysis for Chips

This project focuses on analyzing customer segments and sales patterns in a chips dataset. It involves exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, and various insights into customer behavior and preferences.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights to a client based on the analysis of customer data and transaction data. The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Read and clean the customer dataset and transaction dataset.
   - Merge the datasets based on the customer loyalty card number.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Explore the transaction data to identify any missing values or anomalies.
   - Examine the distribution of sales over time to identify any patterns or trends.

3. Customer Segmentation:
   - Analyze customer segments based on lifestage and customer type.
   - Calculate total sales for each customer segment.
   - Determine the number of customers in each segment.
   - Calculate the average number of chips bought per customer by segment.
   - Compute the average chip price by customer segment.

4. Brand and Packet Size Analysis:
   - Analyze the popularity of different chip brands among the main customer segment.
   - Explore the preferred packet sizes within the customer segment.
   - Identify the top-selling brands within the most preferred packet size.

5. Statistical Analysis:
   - Perform a t-test to compare average chip prices between mainstream and premium/budget customer segments.

6. Insights and Visualizations:
   - Present the findings using visualizations such as bar plots and histograms.
   - Summarize the key insights and observations from the analysis.
